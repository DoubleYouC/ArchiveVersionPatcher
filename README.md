# ArchiveVersionPatcher
Patches Bethesda Archive2 file version from 7 or 8 to 1.

Version 2 adds the ability to operate as a console application. Syntax is:
```
"BA2 Archive Version Patcher.exe" -i "path\to\file\or\folder"
```
Launching without the -i argument launches it into GUI mode. Only in native Python will there be a readout to the console. Log files will still be created if operated as a console application.
